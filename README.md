# Project Overview: E-Commerce Application (MERN Stack )

This project will guide you through building  full-stack E-commerce website  using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to browse products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout. Admin users can manage products, view orders, and update inventory.

## Tech Stack

- **Payment Gateway:** Stripe
- **State Management:** Redux for managing app state
- **Deployment:** Heroku (or any cloud provider like AWS)

## Key Features

- **User Authentication:** 
  - Register, login, and logout functionality with secure password storage using bcryptjs.
  - JWT-based authentication to manage sessions.
  
- **Product Management:**
  - Display products with sorting and filtering options based on categories, price, ratings, etc.

  - Search products by name and filter by categories, price range, and ratings.

- **Security Features:**
  - Input validation and data sanitization.
  - HTTPS support for secure data transmission.



# Milestone 1: 

In a MERN stack application, login and sign-up (authentication) typically involve a process where users can register (sign-up) with their credentials, and later log in using those credentials. The login and sign-up process can be divided into several steps, with separate client-side (React) and server-side (Node.js/Express) handling.

## Milestone 2: Login Page & Authentication Setup

### Description
Milestone 2 focuses on the creation and setup of the **Login Page** for the application, including basic UI elements like forms and fields for user authentication. This milestone also includes setting up Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring responsive and modern design practices. 

### Key Features Completed:
- **Login Page Design**: 
  - Created a responsive login page with email and password inputs.
  - Added "Remember Me" checkbox and "Forgot Password?" link.
  
- **Tailwind CSS Setup**: 
  - Integrated Tailwind CSS for styling the login page with a clean, modern interface.
  - Configured the `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files.

- **New Branch Creation**: 
  - Created a new branch (`milestone-2`) to manage and track the progress for this feature.
  
- **Responsive Layout**: 
  - The login page is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, adjusting for both mobile and desktop views.

### Technologies Used:
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **React Router**: For managing routing (if applicable).
